----------
Const:
If the value is computed at runtime (new DateTime.now(), for example), you can not use a const for it. However, if the value is known at compile time (const a = 1;), then you should use const over final.
There are 2 other large differences between const and final.
  Firstly, if you're using const in class, you have to declare it as static const rather than just const.
  Secondly, if you have a const collection, everything inside of that is in const. If you have a final collection, everything inside of that is not final.

Final:
final should be used over const if you don't know the value at compile time, and it will be calculated/grabbed at runtime. If you want an HTTP response that can't be changed, if you want to get something from a database, or if you want to read from a local file, use final. Anything that isn't known at compile time should be final over const.

尽管Dart是强类型的，但类型声明是可选的，因为Dart可以推断类型。如果要明确说明不需要任何类型，请使用[特殊类型dynamic]。
